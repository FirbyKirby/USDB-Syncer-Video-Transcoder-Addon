# Video Transcoder Addon

Automatically converts downloaded videos in [USDB Syncer](https://github.com/bohning/usdb_syncer) to various formats. After each song download, the addon analyzes the video and, if needed, transcodes it to your target codec using your configuration settings (e.g., H.264 profile, pixel format).

Tip: Transcoding runs automatically. No manual steps needed after installation.

> **Hardware Encoding Limitations**
> When QuickSync hardware encoding is used, certain settings (like `pixel_format`) are constrained to hardware-supported formats (currently NV12). Software encoding respects all configured parameters.

## Overview

Why this exists
- Some video players and karaoke applications do not support, or have limited support, for some common web codecs/containers out of the box (e.g., AV1). One such application is [Melody Mania](https://melodymania.org/) based on the Unity Engine. This addon ensures downloaded videos play reliably by converting them to compatible formats.

What it does
- Transcodes videos to your configured target codec (and applies relevant codec settings and optional limits)
- Supports five target codecs: H.264, HEVC, VP8, VP9, and AV1
- Uses Intel QuickSync hardware encoding when available for much faster encodes
- Copies audio when compatible with the target container; otherwise re-encodes to AAC (MP4/MOV) or Opus (WebM/MKV)
- Updates USDB_Syncer metadata to avoid re-download loops and updates the song’s #VIDEO tag
- Can batch-transcode synchronized videos from the GUI (Tools → Batch Video Transcode). See [docs/BATCH_TRANSCODING.md](docs/BATCH_TRANSCODING.md)

Codec compatibility snapshot
- H.264/AVC (MP4): Best compatibility
- HEVC (MP4): Best quality/size ratio
- VP8/VP9 (WebM): Open formats
- AV1 (MKV/MP4): Next-gen efficiency

See also the architecture notes and compatibility table in [docs/ARCHITECTURE.md](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Installation

Prerequisites
- FFMPEG and FFPROBE must be available. USDB_Syncer can use system PATH or a folder set in its settings. Verification guidance is in [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

Steps
1) Clone or download this repository from GitHub.
2) Place or rename the folder as `video_transcoder` in your USDB_Syncer addons directory.
   - Windows: %LocalAppData%/usdb_syncer/addons
   - macOS: ~/Library/Application Support/usdb_syncer/addons
   - Linux: ~/.local/share/usdb_syncer/addons
3) Restart USDB_Syncer. The log will include: Video Transcoder addon loaded. Hook registration occurs in [__init__.py](__init__.py) and uses the USDB Syncer hooks system.

### Alternative installation: `.zip` addon (loaded directly)

USDB Syncer also supports addons distributed as `.zip` files. This is useful if you prefer a single-file install.

Key requirements and behavior
- Addons can be a Python module, a package folder, **or a `.zip` file** containing one or more Python modules.
- The file must have a `.zip` extension.
- Place the `.zip` file **directly** in the USDB_Syncer addons directory (do not extract it).
- USDB Syncer loads the zip by adding it to `sys.path` (the zip is imported directly and is not unpacked).
- If the addon is a package, the zip should contain a top-level directory with an `__init__.py` file (standard Python package convention).
- No special manifest or metadata file is required.

Example layouts

- Single-module addon:
  - `my_addon.zip` containing `my_addon.py` at the top level
- Package addon:
  - `my_addon.zip` containing `my_addon/__init__.py` (and any other package files)

For this repository, a typical zip install would be `video_transcoder.zip` containing `video_transcoder/__init__.py` and the rest of this addon’s Python files under the `video_transcoder/` directory.

After copying the zip into the addons directory, restart USDB_Syncer. You should see the same addon-loaded log message as with a folder install.

## Configuration

The addon can be configured graphically via **Tools → Video Transcoder Settings** in USDB Syncer.

The runtime configuration file is stored in the USDB Syncer data directory (outside the addon folder). This is required for `.zip`-based addon installs and ensures settings persist across addon upgrades.

Runtime config file location (exact path varies by platform)
- Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\bohning\usdb_syncer\video_transcoder_config.json`
- macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/bohning/usdb_syncer/video_transcoder_config.json`
- Linux: `~/.local/share/bohning/usdb_syncer/video_transcoder_config.json`

Manual editing (advanced)
1) Close USDB Syncer.
2) Edit `video_transcoder_config.json` at the path above.
3) Restart USDB Syncer.

Note: The repository contains [config.json.example](config.json.example:1) as a template for reference. It is not the runtime config file that USDB Syncer reads.

Default config excerpt
```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "auto_transcode_enabled": true,
  "target_codec": "h264",
  "h264": { "profile": "high", "pixel_format": "yuv420p", "crf": 18, "preset": "fast", "container": "mp4" },

  "usdb_integration": { "use_usdb_resolution": true, "use_usdb_fps": true }
}
```

Important paths and behavior
- Runtime config file location: USDB Syncer data directory `video_transcoder_config.json` (created on first run by [config.load_config()](config.py:109))
  - Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\bohning\usdb_syncer\video_transcoder_config.json`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/bohning/usdb_syncer/video_transcoder_config.json`
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/bohning/usdb_syncer/video_transcoder_config.json`
- Backup originals: when enabled, originals are preserved as name-source.ext (see default [config.GeneralConfig](config.py:64))
- Automatic run: executes after each download via the USDB Syncer hooks system
- Force transcode: set [config.GeneralConfig.force_transcode](config.py:79) to true to force transcoding even if the input already matches the target codec and settings. Useful for testing or ensuring fresh encodes. Applies to both automatic and batch workflows
- Optional limits: max_resolution/max_fps/max_bitrate_kbps are applied by codec handlers (see [codecs.py](codecs.py))
- Optional USDB settings integration: use_usdb_resolution/use_usdb_fps can read values from USDB Syncer settings for display and per-file transcode operations (see [transcoder._apply_limits()](transcoder.py:474))
  - Batch note: batch candidate discovery uses your configured general.max_resolution/general.max_fps values directly. If you leave those as null, videos that only exceed USDB limits will not appear as batch candidates

## Transcoding decisions (what triggers a transcode)

The addon now uses strict matching against your configuration rather than a loose “Unity-compatible” check. A file will be transcoded if any of the following is true:
- Target codec mismatch (e.g., file is VP9 but target_codec is h264)
- General caps exceeded: resolution, FPS, or bitrate higher than configured maximums
- Codec setting mismatch for the selected target codec
  - H.264: pixel_format or profile does not match your configuration
  - HEVC: pixel_format or profile does not match your configuration
  - VP8/VP9/AV1: only the codec must match; additional properties are not checked for decision

Notes
> **Note:** The container format is part of the transcoding decision. If the file extension doesn't match the target container configured for the codec, the video will be transcoded.
>
> **Note:** Container format is determined from file extension. If a file has the wrong extension, container mismatch detection may be inaccurate.

## Codec selection guide

H.264 (MP4)
- Best overall compatibility across platforms and Unity versions
- Fastest when QuickSync is available; quality at CRF 18 preset slow is near-lossless
- Recommended default

VP8 (WebM)
- Good fallback if you explicitly need WebM; widely supported in browsers
- Software-only encode; slower than H.264; file sizes often larger than HEVC

H.265/HEVC (MP4)
- Smallest files at similar visual quality compared to H.264
- Decoding support varies. Windows 11 may need the Microsoft HEVC Video Extensions. Some devices lack HEVC playback
- Use when you control the playback environment and know HEVC is supported

Tip: If unsure, pick H.264. Switch to HEVC for smallest files once playback is verified on your target system.

## Hardware acceleration (global controls)

What you need
- Intel CPU with integrated graphics that supports QuickSync
- Windows or Linux with proper drivers
- FFMPEG build that includes QSV encoders/decoders (e.g., h264_qsv, hevc_qsv)

How it behaves
- Global-only controls: toggle [config.GeneralConfig.hardware_encoding](config.py:64) and [config.GeneralConfig.hardware_decode](config.py:64) to affect all codecs
- Auto-selection: when hardware encoding is enabled, the addon selects the best available accelerator via [hwaccel.get_best_accelerator()](hwaccel.py:79)
- Current support: Intel QuickSync only, implemented by [hwaccel.QuickSyncAccelerator](hwaccel.py:121). The architecture permits future accelerators
- AV1 behavior: if targeting AV1 and hardware encoding is enabled, QSV is used when available; otherwise encoding falls back to software AV1 encoders (prefers libsvtav1, then libaom-av1). Encoder selection code path: [codecs.AV1Handler.build_encode_command()](codecs.py:521)

Note: If you set max_resolution or max_fps, the addon may disable hardware decoding for that run to avoid hardware decode + filter pipeline issues, while still using hardware encoding when possible.

## Live progress, abort, and enhanced logging

What you will see during a transcode
- The addon parses FFMPEG stderr in real time to extract progress from lines like time=HH:MM:SS.xx. Parsing helpers: [utils.parse_ffmpeg_progress()](utils.py:77), [utils.time_to_seconds()](utils.py:54)
- Progress is logged roughly every 5 seconds in this format: Transcoding: 45% complete (1:23 / 3:00) [fps=..., speed=...]. Logging occurs inside [transcoder._execute_ffmpeg()](transcoder.py:296) when it encounters time=...
- Before the encode starts, the log includes video properties and the exact FFMPEG command. See [transcoder.process_video()](transcoder.py:41)
  - Example entries: Analyzing video..., Video analysis: codec=..., resolution=..., FFMPEG command: ..., Transcoding video (...)
- On completion, a summary is printed with total wall time and approximate realtime speed. See completion log in [transcoder.process_video()](transcoder.py:285)

How to abort an in-progress transcode
- Click Abort in USDB Syncer. The addon observes both single-transcode and batch-transcode abort sources via [utils.is_aborted()](utils.py:84)
- Abort attempts graceful termination of the active FFmpeg process. Response time is usually quick but can be delayed if FFmpeg isn't producing output. The system will attempt SIGTERM then force-kill if needed. Implementation: [transcoder._execute_ffmpeg()](transcoder.py:297)
- Partial outputs are cleaned automatically: temporary .transcoding* files are removed on abort or failure in [transcoder.process_video()](transcoder.py:189) and [transcoder.process_video()](transcoder.py:213)
- Batch transcode uses the same underlying termination behavior for the active FFmpeg process: worker integration in [BatchWorker](batch_worker.py:1)

Notes
- Abort response is usually quick, but can be delayed if FFmpeg isn't producing output.
- The general timeout still applies as a hard cap: [config.GeneralConfig.timeout_seconds](config.py:76). On timeout, the process is terminated in [transcoder._execute_ffmpeg()](transcoder.py:396)

Performance expectation
- On modest Intel iGPU hardware, a 3-minute video typically encodes in about 1 minute with H.264 QuickSync

Check your environment
- CLI: ffmpeg -encoders | findstr qsv (Windows) or ffmpeg -encoders | grep qsv (macOS/Linux) should list h264_qsv and hevc_qsv
- Logs: when active you will see hardware encoding messages; otherwise a software fallback warning

Warning: On macOS, QuickSync is not used by this addon. It will fall back to software encoding.

## Batch Transcoding (existing library)

Batch transcoding converts an existing library of synchronized videos to your configured target codec and limits.

Key points
- Preview + selection UI with filtering and live statistics
- Disk space estimate; Start is disabled when the estimate exceeds current free space
- Optional rollback protection for the batch
- Results summary + CSV export

Full walkthrough and gotchas (including filtering behavior) are documented in [docs/BATCH_TRANSCODING.md](docs/BATCH_TRANSCODING.md).

Rollback vs backups
- Rollback protection creates temporary copies in a system temp folder for the current batch operation
- Independent of rollback, the `backup_original` setting controls persistent backups stored next to your video files

## Managing Video Backups (Tools → Manage Video Backups...)

Use a single unified workflow to delete or restore backups from one place: scan → select → choose action (Delete or Restore) → confirm → execute → results. The selection dialog presents both options with two action buttons: Delete Selected and Restore Selected.

How backups are discovered
- The manager first looks for an exact stored filename in each song’s sync data: transcoder_source_fname
  - If present and the file exists, it is treated as the backup
- If not present, it searches for files next to the active video that match: <active_video_stem><backup_suffix>*
  - The backup_suffix is configured in [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) and defaults to -source
    - Example with default suffix: MySong.mp4 → MySong-source.mkv or MySong-source.mp4
  - Discovery and validation logic: [backup_manager.py](backup_manager.py)
  
  Access
  - Tools → Manage Video Backups... → [backup_dialog_orchestrator.BackupDialogOrchestrator.start_workflow()](backup_dialog_orchestrator.py:93)
  
  Unified phases
  1) Scan
     - A small progress dialog scans your library for backups. You can cancel the scan
  2) Select
     - A table lists each discovered backup with columns: Title, Artist, Backup File, Size, Date
     - Includes per-row checkboxes, a text filter, Select All / Deselect All, and live Selected count
     - Dialog implementation: [backup_selection_dialog.py](backup_selection_dialog.py)
     - The dialog provides two actions so you can decide after selecting: Delete Selected or Restore Selected
  3) Confirm (depends on chosen action)
     - Delete: shows how many files will be deleted and the total space to be freed
     - Restore: warns that active videos will be overwritten and that a safety backup of the current video will be created first
  4) Execute
     - Delete: per-file deletion with progress and Cancel — UI: [backup_deletion_progress_dialog.py](backup_deletion_progress_dialog.py)
     - Restore: per-file restoration with progress and Cancel — UI: [backup_restore_progress_dialog.py](backup_restore_progress_dialog.py)
  5) Results
     - Delete: summary of succeeded/failed deletions and space freed — UI: [backup_deletion_results_dialog.py](backup_deletion_results_dialog.py)
     - Restore: summary of successfully restored/failed items — UI: [backup_restore_results_dialog.py](backup_restore_results_dialog.py)
  
  Restore behavior and safeguards
  - What restore does: replaces the active transcoded video with the selected backup file
  - Safety backup (temporary): before replacement, the current active video is saved next to it with a .safety-[timestamp] suffix; creation occurs in [backup_manager.restore_backup()](backup_manager.py:207), naming at [backup_manager.restore_backup()](backup_manager.py:231). This safety backup is automatically deleted after a successful restore
  - Metadata update: after restoration, the song’s sync data is updated to reflect the active filename and stored source reference in [backup_manager.restore_backup()](backup_manager.py:246)
  - Backup deletion: after a successful restore, the selected backup file is deleted. Keep a separate copy of the backup file if you want the option to restore again later
- Space stats: the dialog always shows Total Space to Reclaim; during restore it is informational only

Deletion safeguards (unchanged)
- Multi-level confirmation: selection screen → explicit irreversible warning prompt → progress dialog
- Validation before deletion ensures the target is not the active video and that the file exists and is writable
- Space reclaim estimate updates live before you commit to deletion
- Cancel is available during both scanning and deletion; completed deletions are not reverted
- Sync metadata is updated to clear the stored transcoder_source_fname when its backup is removed
- Active transcoded videos are never deleted by this workflow

Scope and limitations
- Affects only persistent user backups created alongside your song files using the configured backup_suffix
- Does not touch temporary rollback backups created by Batch Video Transcode; those live in a separate system temp folder managed by [rollback.py](rollback.py)
- Respects your current backup_suffix setting when searching by pattern; exact matches saved in sync data are honored even if you later change the suffix

Tip: To reduce future backup accumulation, you can disable keeping new originals by setting general.backup_original to false in [docs/CONFIGURATION.md](docs/CONFIGURATION.md). This does not affect existing backups; use the manager to remove or restore them.

## Troubleshooting

Common fixes and checks are documented in [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

## Technical details (for advanced users)

High-level flow
1) Analyze with [video_analyzer.analyze_video()](video_analyzer.py:58)
2) Decide if work is needed via [video_analyzer.needs_transcoding()](video_analyzer.py:198). This step performs strict matching against your configured settings (profile, pixel format, and general caps). See decision rules summarized above and implementation in [video_analyzer.py](video_analyzer.py).
3) Build the FFMPEG command from the codec handler: [codecs.H264Handler](codecs.py:105), [codecs.VP8Handler](codecs.py:216), [codecs.HEVCHandler](codecs.py:305), [codecs.VP9Handler](codecs.py:409), [codecs.AV1Handler](codecs.py:501)
4) Optionally enable hardware decode/encode via [hwaccel.get_best_accelerator()](hwaccel.py:79) and [hwaccel.QuickSyncAccelerator](hwaccel.py:121)
5) Execute and verify; then update sync metadata and the song’s #VIDEO tag via [sync_meta_updater.update_sync_meta_video()](sync_meta_updater.py:25)

Entry points and config
- Hook: USDB Syncer hooks system triggers [transcoder.process_video()](transcoder.py:41)
- Configuration dataclass: [config.TranscoderConfig](config.py:91)
- Batch module: [batch.py](batch.py)

Sync tracking (critical)
- USDB_Syncer uses file mtime to decide if resources are in sync. The addon updates filenames and mtimes accordingly to prevent re-download loops. Details: [sync_meta_updater.py](sync_meta_updater.py)

## FAQ

- Does this run automatically? Yes. The addon subscribes to the USDB Syncer hooks system and processes each newly downloaded song.
- Will my original file be kept? Yes, if general.backup_original is true. The original is renamed to name-source.ext.
- Does it re-encode audio? Audio is copied when compatible with the target container; otherwise it is re-encoded to AAC (MP4/MOV) or Opus (WebM/MKV).
- Which container will I get? Defaults are H.264 → .mp4, VP8/VP9 → .webm, HEVC → .mp4, AV1 → .mkv, but you can override per-codec container via the `container` config key.
- Where is the config file? The runtime config is stored in the USDB Syncer data directory as `video_transcoder_config.json` (created on first run by [config.load_config()](config.py:110)).
  - Windows: `C:\Users\<username>\AppData\Local\bohning\usdb_syncer\video_transcoder_config.json`
  - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/bohning/usdb_syncer/video_transcoder_config.json`
  - Linux: `~/.local/share/bohning/usdb_syncer/video_transcoder_config.json`
- How do I turn off automatic transcoding? Set auto_transcode_enabled to false in the config JSON. The hook still loads but exits early. Batch transcoding remains available via the Tools menu.
- My videos still don’t play. Start with H.264, ensure yuv420p and CFR, and review [docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md](docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md).

When does the addon skip transcoding?
- Only when the input already matches your configured target codec and its checked settings, and does not exceed any configured limits (resolution, FPS, bitrate). For H.264, that includes profile/pixel_format; for HEVC, profile/pixel_format; for VP8/VP9/AV1, the codec must match.

New in this version — progress and abort
- Can I abort a running transcode? Yes. Click Abort in USDB Syncer. The addon detects the abort via [utils.is_aborted()](utils.py:84) and attempts to terminate the active FFmpeg process
- How quickly does abort take effect? Response time is usually quick, but can be delayed if FFmpeg isn't producing output
- Will partial files be left behind? No. Temporary .transcoding* files are removed on abort or failure in [transcoder.process_video()](transcoder.py:189) and [transcoder.process_video()](transcoder.py:213)
- Does batch transcode respect abort? Yes. The active video is stopped immediately and the batch ends; rollback is offered if enabled
